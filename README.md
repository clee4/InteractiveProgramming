This project uses a webcam to take the position of your hand to collide with a ball on screen. The goal is to hit the ball as many times as possible in the time given.

To run the code, OpenCV and pygame need to be installed.
OPENCV INSTALLATION:

$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv

PYGAME INSTALLATION:

$ apt-get build-dep python-pygame
$ apt-get install mercurial python-dev python-numpy ffmpeg libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libsdl1.2-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev
$ pip install pygame

With those installed, type "python qbert.py" in the terminal to run the game. You must be in the right file directory for this command to work.
